# Virtual Try-On System: Tryspec 💎

## Introduction
Welcome to the Virtual Try-On (VTO) System, a cutting-edge application designed to revolutionize the online shopping experience. Utilizing advanced Augmented Reality (AR), Computer Vision, and deep learning techniques, this system aims to offer users a seamless way to virtually try on accessories like glasses and hats in real time. 🚀

## Project Objective 🌟
The primary objective of this project is to provide an enhanced virtual shopping experience by allowing users to interact with products before making a purchase. This reduces uncertainty, builds confidence, and bridges the gap between online and in-store shopping.

## Features and Benefits 🏠
- **Real-Time Try-On**: Leveraging AR, users can see how accessories look on them instantly, enhancing the shopping experience.
- **Dynamic Product Selection**: Browse and toggle between various glasses and hats, allowing users to see different styles at the click of a button.
- **Adaptive Personalization**: Adjusts the position and size of accessories dynamically based on facial landmarks, ensuring accurate fitting.
- **User-Friendly Experience**: Simple and intuitive interface designed for effortless use across all demographics.

## Technology Stack 🛠️
- **Computer Vision & AR**: Powered by OpenCV and MediaPipe, for precise facial landmark detection and accurate overlay of virtual accessories.
- **Machine Learning**: Enhanced personalization of the try-on experience by learning from user interactions.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used, leveraging libraries like NumPy and OpenCV.

## Implementation Highlights 🤖
- **Landmark Detection**: Utilizes MediaPipe's face mesh to identify facial landmarks in real time, providing accurate points to position accessories like glasses and hats.
- **Dynamic Sizing and Positioning**: Facial dimensions are calculated dynamically to adjust accessory scaling, ensuring a realistic and comfortable fit.
- **Real-Time Selection**: Users can toggle between different styles of glasses and hats by pressing keys, providing an interactive and exploratory shopping experience.
